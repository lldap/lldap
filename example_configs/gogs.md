# Gogs LDAP configuration

Gogs can make use of LDAP and therefore lldap.

The following configuration is adapted from the example configuration at [their repository](https://github.com/thchha/lldap/new/main/example_configs).
The example is a container configuration - the file should just needs to live within `conf/auth.d/some_name.conf`:

```
$ cat /srv/git/gogs/conf/auth.d/ldap_bind_dn.conf
id           = 101
type         = ldap_bind_dn
name         = LDAP BindDN
is_activated = true
is_default   = true

[config]
host               = ldap.example.com
port               = 6360
# 0 - Unencrypted, 1 - LDAPS, 2 - StartTLS
security_protocol  = 1
skip_verify        = true
bind_dn            = uid=<binduser>,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
bind_password      = `yourPasswordInBackticks`
user_base          = dc=example,dc=com
attribute_username = uid
attribute_name     = givenName
attribute_surname  = sn
attribute_mail     = mail
attributes_in_bind = false
# restricts on the `user_base`.
filter             = (&(objectClass=person)(uid=%s))
# The initial administrator has to enable admin privileges.
# This is only possible for users who were logged in once.
# This renders the following filter obsolete; Though its response is accepted by Gogs.
admin_filter       = (memberOf=cn=<yourAdminGroup>,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)
```

The `binduser` shall be a member of `lldap_strict_readonly`.
The group `yourAdminGroup` should be adapted to your requirement - Otherwise the entire line can be omitted.
The diamond brakets are for readability and are not required.
