## Default configuration for Docker.
## All the values can be overridden through environment variables. For
## instance, "ldap_port" can be overridden with the "LDAP_PORT" variable.

## The port on which to have the LDAP server.
#ldap_port = 3890

## The port on which to have the HTTP server, for user login and
## administration.
#http_port = 17170

## Random secret for JWT signature.
## This secret should be random, and should be shared with application
## servers that need to consume the JWTs.
## Changing this secret will invalidate all user sessions and require
## them to re-login.
## You should probably set it through the JWT_SECRET environment
## variable from a secret ".env" file.
## You can generate it with (on linux):
## LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9!"#%&'\''()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~' </dev/urandom | head -c 32; echo ''
#jwt_secret = "REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM"

## Base DN for LDAP.
## This is usually your domain name, and is used as a
## namespace for your users. The choice is arbitrary, but will be needed
## to configure the LDAP integration with other services.
## The sample value is for "example.com", but you can extend it with as
## many "dc" as you want, and you don't actually need to own the domain
## name.
#ldap_base_dn = "dc=example,dc=com"

## Admin username.
## For the LDAP interface, a value of "admin" here will create the LDAP
## user "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" (with the base DN above).
## For the administration interface, this is the username.
#ldap_user_dn = "admin"

## Admin password.
## Password for the admin account, both for the LDAP bind and for the
## administration interface.
## You can set it with the LDAP_USER_PASS environment variable.
## Note: you can create another admin user for LDAP/administration, this
## is just the default one.
#ldap_user_pass = "REPLACE_WITH_PASSWORD"

## Database URL.
## This encodes the type of database (SQlite, Mysql and so
## on), the path, the user, password, and sometimes the mode (when
## relevant).
## Note: Currently, only SQlite is supported. SQlite should come with
## "?mode=rwc" to create the DB if not present.
## Example URLs:
##  - "postgres://postgres-user:password@postgres-server/my-database"
##  - "mysql://mysql-user:password@mysql-server/my-database"
##
## This can be overridden with the DATABASE_URL env variable.
database_url = "sqlite:///data/users.db?mode=rwc"

## Private key file.
## Contains the secret private key used to store the passwords safely.
## Note that even with a database dump and the private key, an attacker
## would still have to perform an (expensive) brute force attack to find
## each password.
## Randomly generated on first run if it doesn't exist.
key_file = "/data/private_key"
