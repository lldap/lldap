## Default configuration for Docker.
## All the values can be overridden through environment variables, prefixed
## with "LLDAP_". For instance, "ldap_port" can be overridden with the
## "LLDAP_LDAP_PORT" variable.

## Tune the logging to be more verbose by setting this to be true.
## You can set it with the LLDAP_VERBOSE environment variable.
# verbose=false

## The port on which to have the LDAP server.
#ldap_port = 3890

## The port on which to have the HTTP server, for user login and
## administration.
#http_port = 17170

## The public URL of the server, for password reset links.
#http_url = "http://localhost"

## Random secret for JWT signature.
## This secret should be random, and should be shared with application
## servers that need to consume the JWTs.
## Changing this secret will invalidate all user sessions and require
## them to re-login.
## You should probably set it through the LLDAP_JWT_SECRET environment
## variable from a secret ".env" file.
## This can also be set from a file's contents by specifying the file path
## in the LLDAP_JWT_SECRET_FILE environment variable
## You can generate it with (on linux):
## LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9!"#%&'\''()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~' </dev/urandom | head -c 32; echo ''
#jwt_secret = "REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM"

## Base DN for LDAP.
## This is usually your domain name, and is used as a
## namespace for your users. The choice is arbitrary, but will be needed
## to configure the LDAP integration with other services.
## The sample value is for "example.com", but you can extend it with as
## many "dc" as you want, and you don't actually need to own the domain
## name.
#ldap_base_dn = "dc=example,dc=com"

## Admin username.
## For the LDAP interface, a value of "admin" here will create the LDAP
## user "cn=admin,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" (with the base DN above).
## For the administration interface, this is the username.
#ldap_user_dn = "admin"

## Admin password.
## Password for the admin account, both for the LDAP bind and for the
## administration interface. It is only used when initially creating
## the admin user.
## It should be minimum 8 characters long.
## You can set it with the LLDAP_LDAP_USER_PASS environment variable.
## This can also be set from a file's contents by specifying the file path
## in the LLDAP_LDAP_USER_PASS_FILE environment variable
## Note: you can create another admin user for user administration, this
## is just the default one.
#ldap_user_pass = "REPLACE_WITH_PASSWORD"

## Database URL.
## This encodes the type of database (SQlite, Mysql and so
## on), the path, the user, password, and sometimes the mode (when
## relevant).
## Note: Currently, only SQlite is supported. SQlite should come with
## "?mode=rwc" to create the DB if not present.
## Example URLs:
##  - "postgres://postgres-user:password@postgres-server/my-database"
##  - "mysql://mysql-user:password@mysql-server/my-database"
##
## This can be overridden with the DATABASE_URL env variable.
database_url = "sqlite:///data/users.db?mode=rwc"

## Private key file.
## Contains the secret private key used to store the passwords safely.
## Note that even with a database dump and the private key, an attacker
## would still have to perform an (expensive) brute force attack to find
## each password.
## Randomly generated on first run if it doesn't exist.
key_file = "/data/private_key"

## Ignored attributes.
## Some services will request attributes that are not present in LLDAP. When it
## is the case, LLDAP will warn about the attribute being unknown. If you want
## to ignore the attribute and the service works without, you can add it to this
## list to silence the warning.
#ignored_user_attributes = [ "sAMAccountName" ]
#ignored_group_attributes = [ "mail", "userPrincipalName" ]

## Options to configure SMTP parameters, to send password reset emails.
## To set these options from environment variables, use the following format
## (example with "password"): LLDAP_SMTP_OPTIONS__PASSWORD
#[smtp_options]
## Whether to enabled password reset via email, from LLDAP.
#enable_password_reset=true
## The SMTP server.
#server="smtp.gmail.com"
## The SMTP port.
#port=587
## Whether to connect with TLS.
#tls_required=true
## The SMTP user, usually your email address.
#user="sender@gmail.com"
## The SMTP password.
#password="password"
## The header field, optional: how the sender appears in the email. The first
## is a free-form name, followed by an email between <>.
#from="LLDAP Admin <sender@gmail.com>"
## Same for reply-to, optional.
#reply_to="Do not reply <noreply@localhost>"

## Options to configure LDAPS.
## To set these options from environment variables, use the following format
## (example with "port"): LLDAP_LDAPS_OPTIONS__PORT
#[ldaps_options]
## Whether to enable LDAPS.
#enabled=true
## Port on which to listen.
#port=6360
## Certificate file.
#cert_file="/data/cert.pem"
## Certificate key file.
#key_file="/data/key.pem"
